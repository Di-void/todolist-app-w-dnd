## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html) - Typescript
- [Tailwind Css](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - For styles
- [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) - State Management Library

### What I learned

I learned to use a couple things for the first time in this project. Some of them were, Zustand and Jotai for state management in the application. I also used @dnd-kit for making draggable and droppable copmonents for the first time in this project. In short, it was a really enjoyable learning experience for me this oneüòÅ.

```js
set((state) => {
  if (state.activeTab === "all") {
    state.todos = reArrangedTodos;
    state.allTodos = reArrangedTodos;
  } else if (state.activeTab === "active") {
    state.todos = reArrangedTodos;
    state.activeTodos = reArrangedTodos;
  } else {
    state.todos = reArrangedTodos;
    state.completedTodos = reArrangedTodos;
  }
});
```

### Continued development

To be honest, this is not where I want this project to finally be. I plan to tinker with the @dnd-kit library a little more and make some improvements to the UX of the application. I plan to provide support for checking and unchecking the checkbox with your keyboard alone as I think that would lead to better UX. That is just one among the few updates I want to make to the application going forward.

### Useful resources

- [The dnd kit Official Docs](https://docs.dndkit.com/) - The dnd-kit official docs website is really good in my opinion.
- [dnd-kit codesandbox examples](https://codesandbox.io/examples/package/@dnd-kit/core) - This was a good one for reference and for demos but the example I saw for my use-case wasn't really beginner friendly. I wish it could be a bit better.
- [The Zustand Github Repo Docs and examples](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) - This was another good reference point for using Zustand. I really like Poimandres now.
